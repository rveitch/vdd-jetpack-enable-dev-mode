Plugin Name: VDD: Jetpack Enable Development Mode
Plugin URI: https://github.com/rveitch/

/*
* NOTES:
* While in Development Mode, some features will not be available at all as
* they require a WordPress.com for all functionalityâ€”Related Posts, for example.
* Other features will have reduced functionality to give developers a good-faith
* representation of the feature. For example, Tiled Galleries requires the
* WordPress.com Photon CDN; however, in Development Mode, Jetpack provides a
* fallback so developers can have a similar experience during development
* and testing.
